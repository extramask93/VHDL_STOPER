# VHDL_STOPER
Second project that i have done during classes, it's made of couple of modules
and implements moore's state machine. It's not the production code and may be buggy! How it works? It counts time with resolution of 1 ms and allows user to 
stop,reset and register lap times. It counts up to 100s.
